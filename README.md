[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/f9b129e6-a4a6-493d-8fcd-9bf90324c41d/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/our-wedding/deploys)

Website for our wedding where people can see information and RSVP.

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd rsvp
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

Consult [sapper.svelte.dev](https://sapper.svelte.dev) for help getting started.

## Structure

Sapper expects to find two directories in the root of your project — `src` and `static`.

### src

The [src](src) directory contains the entry points for your app — `client.js`, `server.js` and (optionally) a `service-worker.js` — along with a `template.html` file and a `routes` directory.

#### src/routes

This is the heart of your Sapper app. There are two kinds of routes — _pages_, and _server routes_.

**Pages** are Svelte components written in `.svelte` files. When a user first visits the application, they will be served a server-rendered version of the route in question, plus some JavaScript that 'hydrates' the page and initialises a client-side router. From that point forward, navigating to other pages is handled entirely on the client for a fast, app-like feel. (Sapper will preload and cache the code for these subsequent pages, so that navigation is instantaneous.)

**Server routes** are modules written in `.js` files, that export functions corresponding to HTTP methods. Each function receives Express `request` and `response` objects as arguments, plus a `next` function. This is useful for creating a JSON API, for example.

There are three simple rules for naming the files that define your routes:

- A file called `src/routes/about.svelte` corresponds to the `/about` route. A file called `src/routes/blog/[slug].svelte` corresponds to the `/blog/:slug` route, in which case `params.slug` is available to the route
- The file `src/routes/index.svelte` (or `src/routes/index.js`) corresponds to the root of your app. `src/routes/about/index.svelte` is treated the same as `src/routes/about.svelte`.
- Files and directories with a leading underscore do _not_ create routes. This allows you to colocate helper modules and components with the routes that depend on them — for example you could have a file called `src/routes/_helpers/datetime.js` and it would _not_ create a `/_helpers/datetime` route
